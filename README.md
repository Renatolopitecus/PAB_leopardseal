# PAB_leopardseal
This repository provides supplementary data from the publication "First Record of Maternal Behavior in Leopard Seals: The Longest Documented Cases of Postmortem Attentive Behavior in Pinnipeds", led by Renato Borras-Chavez and Emily Sperou.
The repository contains original photos and videos related to the Postmortem Attentive Behavior (PAB) events described in the manuscript, as well as documentation of the necropsy performed on a leopard seal pup in 2023.
The “PAB_Videos” folder includes recordings of all four PAB events reported in the study: Three events were observed in San Rafael and involved the same adult female (LSR01) across different years (videos: LSR01_2021, LSR01_2023, and LSR01_2024). The fourth event (TF13_2021) was recorded in Parry Fjord, Tierra del Fuego (Southern Patagonia, Chile), and involved a different female (TF13) in November 2021.

The “Necropsy” folder documents the necropsy of a leopard seal pup conducted by Emily Sperou and Renato Borras-Chavez in November 2023 at San Rafael Lagoon National Park, Aysén Region, Chile. Based on morphological characteristics, the pup was estimated to be less than one week old at the time of death. The carcass, recovered 28 days after birth, showed minimal decomposition, likely due to extended exposure to cold temperatures on ice. This folder contains two subfolders: "Necropsy Images", which include external views, internal organ photos, and skull images, and "Videos", documenting external observations of the dead pup as described in the manuscript.
To download the videos, follow these simple instructions:
1.	Navigate to the folder of interest (PAB_Videos or Necropsy/Videos), 2. Click on a video file (e.g., LSR01_2024.mp4). 3.	Click “Download” in the right corner (or right-click the “Download” button and choose “Save As”). Note: If GitHub displays a message like “This file is stored with Git LFS and won’t display,” proceed with the download — the full video will download correctly.
Additionally, the repository includes a Word document containing the two supplementary tables referenced in the manuscript.
